Things To Do:

    Fixes:
        - abnormal lap checks disabled for pitpassing and + 1 lap (fix not working)
            > why does it skip long pit laps but not long laps after pit?
        - Reset after drop_out goes back on track (fix not working)
        - Combine DriverStintCheck and AbnormlLapCheck (One Object)
        - long laps on yellow flag
        - AbnormalLapCheck -> check_time()
            > self.last_time can resolve to "IN PIT" and not a timestamp. Error safe for now but maybe
                think of a better way to handle it... also WTF Orbits?!?!
    Features:
        - Log file
        - check for TX passings < 10 ms apart (wrongly assigned tx)
        - UI?

    Done:
        - Double pit stops aren't being recorded
