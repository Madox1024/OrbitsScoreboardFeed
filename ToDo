Things To Do:

    Fixes:
        - Why is it Freezing after dropouts?
        - Reset after drop_out goes back on track *Possibly Fixed*
        - Passing around passing_file_name through too many fxns, figure a better way?
        - look up Cygwin


    Features:
        - Limit Resource workload by adding lap# checking against last lap#, only trigger checks when lap# changes
        - Objectify Parser.py
        - Implement In-pit Out-pit into DSC
            > Ask Mike and other Pit dudes how accurate the pit stall export is.
        - Print double (or more) pit stops (pit passings in a row)
        - Tests (test_all() fxn)
        - check for TX passings < 10 ms apart (wrongly assigned tx)
        - UI?


    Done:
        - Objectify Main.py and Parser.py
        - Missing Driver continues to trigger b/c driver_stint_dict is formed outside of WT loop in Main.py
            > Objectifying Main.py could make this easier to solve
            > line 94 possibly fix needs testing
        - abnormal lap checks disabled for pitpassing and + 1 lap (if since_pit > 2: *check laps*)

        - Log file
            > log(string) in Util.py

        - long laps on not-green flag (use self.flag)

        - AbnormalLapCheck -> check_time()
            > self.last_time can resolve to "IN PIT" and not a timestamp. Error safe for now but maybe
                think of a better way to handle it... also WTF Orbits?!?!
            > *** Fixed - added if to catch '' and 'IN PIT' to start_abnormal_lap_check() ***

        - Double pit stops aren't being logged
            > *** Fixed - double pit stops will be monitored but not logged ***
