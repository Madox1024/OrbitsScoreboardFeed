Things To Do:

    Fixes:
        - long laps on yellow flag (use self.flag)
        - Double pit stops aren't being logged (Driver obj will be updated every cycle but log() only called after
            S/F lap)
        - Reset after drop_out goes back on track (need to test)
        - AbnormalLapCheck -> check_time()
            > self.last_time can resolve to "IN PIT" and not a timestamp. Error safe for now but maybe
                think of a better way to handle it... also WTF Orbits?!?!
    Features:
        - check for TX passings < 10 ms apart (wrongly assigned tx)
        - UI?

    Done:
        - abnormal lap checks disabled for pitpassing and + 1 lap (if since_pit > 2: *check laps*)
        - Log file
            > log(string) in Util.py
