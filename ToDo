Things To Do:

    Fixes:
        - Limit Resource workload by adding lap# checking against last lap#, only trigger when lap# changes
        - Reset after drop_out goes back on track *Possibly Fixed*


    Features:
        - check for TX passings < 10 ms apart (wrongly assigned tx)
        - UI?


    Done:
        - abnormal lap checks disabled for pitpassing and + 1 lap (if since_pit > 2: *check laps*)

        - Log file
            > log(string) in Util.py

        - long laps on not-green flag (use self.flag) NEED TO TEST

        - AbnormalLapCheck -> check_time()
            > self.last_time can resolve to "IN PIT" and not a timestamp. Error safe for now but maybe
                think of a better way to handle it... also WTF Orbits?!?!
            > *** Fixed - added if to catch '' and 'IN PIT' to start_abnormal_lap_check() ***

        - Double pit stops aren't being logged
            > *** Fixed - pit stops will be monitored but not logged ***
